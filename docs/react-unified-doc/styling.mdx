# Styling

`react-unified-doc` renders a HTML document that maintains high fidelity with the source content.  The only additional rendered nodes are `mark` elements (with `data-start` and `data-end` attributes), which are created to indicate annotated text nodes.  This low-level and non-opinionated approach to rendering and annotating documents allows for simple customizations with familiar CSS.
