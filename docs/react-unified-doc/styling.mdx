# Styling

`react-unified-doc` renders a HTML document that maintains high fidelity with the source content.  The only modifications made to the document is semantic additions of `mark` nodes (with `data-start` and `data-end` attributes) when `text` nodes are annotated.  This non-opinionated approach allows for easy document customizations with familiar web technologies such as CSS.
