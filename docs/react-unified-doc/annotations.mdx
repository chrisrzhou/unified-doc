# Annotations

Annotating documents is simple and declarative by providing an array of `annotations`.  You can control tooltip behaviors, display annotation labels, or turn annotated nodes into permalinks.  Annotations support click and hover callbacks.

You can also create and update `annotations` when selecting text in the document.  Use the `onSelectText` prop to capture the newly created annotation and update the `annotations` in a controlled manner.  The [next section](./selecting-text) covers this in more detail.
