# Annotations

Annotating documents is easily supported by simply using the `annotations` prop.  You can control tooltip behaviors and display annotation labels.  Annotations support click and hover callbacks.

In the following example, you can also create new `annotations` by selecting text in the document. The [next section](./managing-annotations) provides an interactive example that covers this in more detail.
