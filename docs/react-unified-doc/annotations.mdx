# Annotations

Annotating documents is easily supported by simply using the `annotations` prop.  You can control tooltip behaviors, display annotation labels, or turn annotated nodes into permalinks.  Annotations support click and hover callbacks.

You can also create new `annotations` when selecting text in the document.  Use the `onSelectText` prop to capture the newly created annotation and update the `annotations` data in a controlled manner.  The [next section](./selecting-text) provides an interactive example that covers this in more detail.
