# Annotations

[View source](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/unified-doc/tree/master/docs/react-unified-doc/src/example-annotations.tsx)

Annotating documents is simple and declarative by providing an array of `annotations`.  You can control tooltip behaviors, display annotation labels, or turn annotated nodes into permalinks.  Annotations support click and hover callbacks.
