# Plugins

Apply valid [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/master/doc/plugins.md) plugins to supercharge your document.  Note that annotations may not work on nodes that are mutated (added/updated/removed) by plugins.  The `onSelectText` callback is also disabled since the rendered content may be mutated by plugins.
