# Plugins

[View source](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/unified-doc/tree/master/docs/react-unified-doc/examples/plugins.tsx)

Apply valid [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype/blob/master/doc/plugins.md) plugins to supercharge your document.  Note that annotations will not work on source nodes that mutated (added/updated/removed) from plugins.  The `onSelectText` callback is also disabled since we cannot guarantee immutability of the existing tree when custom plugins are applied.
