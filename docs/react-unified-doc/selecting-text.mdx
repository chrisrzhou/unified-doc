# Selecting Text

`react-unified-doc` provides a useful `onSelectText` callback that will capture any selected text in the document as a basic annotation object.  It performs offset calculations internally to compute the final data irregardless of DOM nodes traversed.

Use this captured annotation object to update `annotations` declaratively to create unique user experiences!
