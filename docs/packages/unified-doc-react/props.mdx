# Props

`unified-doc-react` provides a simple set of props to render and annotate content.

<Props of={ComponentProps} />

## `Annotation`

An `annotation` object takes the following interface:

```ts
interface Annotation {
  /** Additional annotation data */
  [key: string]: any;
  /** Unique ID is required for annotation algorithm to work.  It is also used to uniquely assign ID values to generated <mark /> nodes which is convenient for selecting the element itself. */
  id: string;
  /** Start offset relative to the source content */
  startOffset: number;
  /** End offset relative to the source content */
  endOffset: number;
  /** CSS classnames that will be applied on the annotated nodes */
  classNames?: string[];
  /** If true, will add the value to the `label` tag attribute.  Useful for displaying the label with custom CSS:before selectors. */
  label?: string;
  /** Apply custom styles to the annotated node. Note that use of `classNames` prop is preferred. */
  style?: any;
}
```

## `AnnotationCallback`

```ts
type AnnotationCallback = (annotation: Annotation, e?: MouseEvent) => void;
```

## `Plugin`

[rehype][rehype] plugins are applied after annotations. Note that annotations only operate on source content, so any plugin that mutates and creates new content outside of the source content cannot be annotated.
