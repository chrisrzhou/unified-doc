# Props

`unified-doc-react` provides a simple set of props to render and annotate content.

<Props of={ComponentProps} />

## `Annotation`

The `annotation` object takes the following interface. Additional data can be provided to the object, which is useful when used with relevant `AnnotationCallback` callbacks.

<Props of={AnnotationInterface} />

## `AnnotationCallback`

```ts
type AnnotationCallback = (annotation: Annotation, e?: MouseEvent) => void;
```

## `Plugin`

[rehype][rehype] plugins are applied after annotations. Note that annotations only operate on source content, so any plugin that mutates and creates new content outside of the source content cannot be annotated.
