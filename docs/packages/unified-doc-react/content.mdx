# Content

Easily render any `html`, `markdown`, or `text` content. The rendered document is a safely-sanitized HTML document that maintains high fidelity with the source content.

You can provide a valid [sanitize-schema](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-sanitize#schema) to apply custom HTML sanitization. Improper use of this schema can open you up to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The defaults are safe, but deviating from them is likely unsafe.
