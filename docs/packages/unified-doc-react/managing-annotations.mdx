# Managing Annotations

It is common for applications to provide a way to manage annotations (create, remove, link).  The following example demonstrates how to use the `onSelectText` callback to create an annotation based on the text captured in the document.  You can also click on marked text in the document to confirm removing annotations.

This example also shows that annotations can be managed in a  *controlled* manner.  You can remove annotation tags to remove them in the documents.  Click on the annotation tag to jump/link to it in the document.
