# Annotations

Annotating documents is easily supported by declaring the `annotations` prop. You can control tooltip behaviors and conditionally display annotation labels. Annotations support click and hover callbacks.

In the following example, you can create new `annotations` by selecting text in the document. The [next section](./controlled-annotations) provides an interactive example that covers this in more detail.
