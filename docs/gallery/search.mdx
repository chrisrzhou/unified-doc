# Search

An example showing how to search a document and jump to the matched entry when clicking on a search result snippet.

This example uses a naive Javascript `match` implementation to generate search result snippets.  Search result snippets may contain 'broken' DOM substrings. You can expand on this example by using formal search libraries or integrating with a backend search API.

> Note that in the future, it is possible to implement a `unified` approach to search `text` nodes of `hast` trees (e.g. `hast-util-text-search`).
