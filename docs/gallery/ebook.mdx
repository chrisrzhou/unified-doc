# Ebook

An Ebook example supporting simple bookmark management.
- To create a bookmark, select some text in the document and confirm the action.
- To remove a bookmark, click on the marked text in the document and confirm the action.
- Configure the bookmark category to visually distinguish types of bookmarks.
- Click on the bookmark tags to jump to the bookmark in the document.

This example is simplistic and uses the `window.confirm` method to implement bookmark actions.  You can expand on this example by using the mouse event returned by the relevant callback props (`onAnnotationClick`, `onSelectText`) to build more advanced and interactive user experiences.
