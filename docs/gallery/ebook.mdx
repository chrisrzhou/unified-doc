# Ebook

## Description
An Ebook example supporting simple bookmark management.
- To create a bookmark, select some text in the document and confirm the action.
- To remove a bookmark, click on the marked text in the document and confirm the action.
- Configure the bookmark category to visually distinguish types of bookmarks.
- Click on the bookmark tags to jump to the bookmark in the document.

## Implementation
This example is extremely simple and uses the `window.confirm` method to implement bookmark actions.  These actions are implemented using the `onSelectText` and `onAnnotationClick` props.

## Improvements
You can create more interactive bookmark workflows by taking advantage of the mouse event returned by the relevant callback props (`onAnnotationClick`, `onSelectText`).

## Concepts
- Customizable annotations.
- Permalinks to annotated nodes.
