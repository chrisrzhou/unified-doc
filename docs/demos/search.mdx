# Search

## Description

A demo showing how to search a document, and jump to the matched entry in the document when clicking on a search results.

## Implementation

This demo uses a naive Javascript `match` implementation to generate search result snippets. These snippets assume the `annotation` shape naturally, and can therefore be easily integrated as annotations in the document. Linking to the annotated node in the document is done using default browser behaviors with anchor links.

## Improvements

You can use formal search libraries or integrate with a backend search API (e.g. [Elasticsearch unified highlighter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search-request-highlighting.html#unified-highlighter)). Note that the snippets algorithm used in this demo is naive, and you may notice broken 'DOM' substrings. In the future, it is possible to implement a `unified` approach to perform robust searches on `text` nodes of `hast` trees.

## Concepts

- Permalinks to annotated nodes.
