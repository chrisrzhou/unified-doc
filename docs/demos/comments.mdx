# Comments

## Description
This demo shows how commenting (and other similar custom post-annotation rendering) can be implemented using just the `annotations` prop and rendering comment nodes relative to the annotated nodes.

## Implementation
The comment data is mocked in a simple way using the array index as data.  This implementation uses an effect hook and vanilla DOM methods to render comment nodes.

Since all annotated nodes contain the `data-id` attribute, you can select these nodes with the relevant document `querySelector`. Note that the `id` attribute is conveniently and *uniquely* provided for annotated nodes that have the `data-start="true"` attribute values.  This demo uses the `data-start`, `data-end` attributes to determine how comment nodes are placed.

## Improvements
You can improve this demo by formally building out a commenting workflow with relevant data.  Note that the `annotation` object could hold onto the `comments` data related to the annotation.  You can also improve the comment nodes with better CSS and design.

## Concepts
- Custom post-annotation rendering with web technologies.
- Annotation `data-` attributes.
- Custom CSS.
