# Ebook

## Description

An Ebook demo supporting simple bookmark management.

- To create a bookmark, select some text in the document and confirm the action.
- To remove a bookmark, click on the marked text in the document and confirm the action.
- Configure the bookmark category to visually distinguish types of bookmarks.
- Click on the bookmark tags to jump to the bookmark in the document.

## Implementation

This demo is extremely simple and uses the `window.confirm` method to implement bookmark actions. These actions are implemented using the `annotationCallbacks` and `onSelectText` props.

## Improvements

You can create more interactive bookmark workflows by taking advantage of the mouse event returned by the relevant callback props (`annotationCallbacks`, `onSelectText`).

## Concepts

- Creating annotations from text selections.
- Customizable annotations.
- Permalinks to annotated nodes.
