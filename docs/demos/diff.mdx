# Diff

## Description

A demo showing how to diff two files and using different ways to display the diffs. This demo preloads HTML and markdown content for comparison. This is a cool way to visualize how markdown differs _just slightly_ from HTML, and why markdown is an _awesome_ markup language that is interoperable with HTML!

Use the sidebar to customize your own contents for diffing. You can view the old, new, and diff documents using the dropdown below.

An interesting application of this demo is the ability to visually diff only the text content and ignore other HTML elements.  When using `html` as the selected content type, you will only see the diff highlights for text content and not the HTML elements.

## Implementation

The demo uses the [`diff`](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff) package to diff two string content with the `diffChars` method. Upon receiving the diffed parts, we can loop over it to construct the `diffContent` and easily keep track and assemble `annotations` in a single loop. Simple CSS is then used to style removed or added parts.

## Improvement

It would be interesting to find a way to apply Github diff styles that highlight the lines that are changed in addition to the diff characters.

## Concepts

- Constructing annotations by reshaping data.
- Custom CSS.
